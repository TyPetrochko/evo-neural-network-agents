TODO:
1) Remove global "evolve" and force interaction for crossover
	a) Grey out (temporarily?) "Evolve" button?
	b) Perhaps redesign UI to give "Simulate Mating"
	   feature?
3) Create new "GenericAgent" class
	a) Create generic Sensor and Actuator interfaces that
	   can be represented by input and output neurons
	   respectively (consider Component interface? 
	   Probably not, but we can refer to them both as
	   components from here-on-out))
	b) Move rendering code to agent/sensors/actuators 
3) Rewrite OptimizableNeuralNetwork to evolve inputs and outputs

FUTURE IDEAS:
	- Need combat components
	- Need communication components
		- olfactory components
		- auditory components
		- wavelength-based visual components
		
	- More advanced rendering code to support .PNG's for
	  sensors/actuators
	- Create "base" agents with a few minimal sensors/
	  actuators
